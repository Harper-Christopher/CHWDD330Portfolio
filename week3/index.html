        <li>When accessing form elements and working with JavaScript to control the form, use [] for the form attribute names as just the .name has the potential of activating properties and methods instead of the form element.</li>
        <li>When submitting data to forms, we can actually stop the data being submitted the the form all together by using the event.preventDefault();</li>    
        <li>Place holders can both in done in JavaScript and within the HTML code. JavaScript uses the input.addEventListener and focus, and then blur. HTML can be placed as placeholder = 'your message' right in the input boxes. The HTML placeholder will not be submitted with a form if accidently left.</li>
        <li>type='hidden' Hidden input fields are visible within the HTML and should not be used for sensitive information.</li>
        <li>Input type <label for='age'>Age:<input type='number' id='age' name='age' min=0 step=1></label></li>
        <li>Checkboxes can be set to true using JavaScript by setting it's 'checked' property to true.</li>
        <li>When creating new objects with JavaScript we don't need to use parentheses, however, we do need them if we are passing arguments such as const whiteDice = new Dice(4);</li>
        <li>object methods are public by default in JavaScript. Reason being Methods can be changed and modified after they have been created.</li> 
        <li>Polymorphism is basically the concept of different objects being able to use the same methods </li>
        <li>When using objects they must either have getters or setters, then cannot use both of them.</li>
        <li>Modules are very useful in order to use little pieces of code instead of monolithic libraries and helping avoid wasted code. </li>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>This week I was really noticing how prevalent the arrow function has become =>, I originally started JavaScripting a couple years ago in CIT160 and don't remember the arrow function at all. I understand this is new to ES6, what do you feel is the best method? I know there are some benefits for small code and potential load increase, but there are draw backs a limitations to the arrow function.</li>
        <li>Polymorphism has also been kind of confusing to me, so it's not any specific function but rather the definition of being able to modify multiple methods through the same process to be something other then the default toString()?</li>
    </ol>
