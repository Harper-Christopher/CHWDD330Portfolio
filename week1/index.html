        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ol id="weeks">
            <li>This week I was able to read all of the material. In Doing Stuff With Web Things I thought it was funny how computers are actually stupid, they can seem smart at first but they're just faster at being stupid. The video was AWESOME, it really had me thinking how bad I am at designing with the large view in mind first and then scaling it down, for whatever reason it's always been easier for me. It never really occurred to me with designing with all the important things at the bottom so they can be clicked easier, also again with the importance of designing with mobile format first seeing how that's what everyone uses now a days. The menu was interesting as I've built pages before in previous classes and had my father-in-law asking what the bars were which was the menu, so that made me think of the importance of spelling out menu with it, it never occurred though about adding the border which will help identifying it as a button to click which will get more hits. </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I spent quite a bit of time relearning how to use JavaScript to add the li elements in the ordered list, and then on top of that had to turn around and try to figure out how to turn the li content to a link using an array. It was quite the task to get back into thinking JavaScript programming again. Question, what is the benefit of using JavaScript to add elements an content versus just adding the HTML. I'm thinking it might be quicker and easier to modify large amounts of content but I'm not sure.</li>
