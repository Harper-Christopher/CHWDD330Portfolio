    <ol>
        <li>Under the Aliases section of Chapter 15, you're able to import functions for example import square from './square.js';. They then say your could also just use import sq from './square.js';, and then just use sq() to call the square() function within the square.js file. How does the program know your calling the square function by just using sq() though it's really named square() within the JS file?</li>
